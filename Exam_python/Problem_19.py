# 20. Accessing and merging dictionaries

# Combine `dict1`, `dict2`, and `dict3` into `my_dict`. In addition, get the value of `special_key` from `my_dict` into a `special_value` variable. Note that original dictionaries should stay untouched and `special_key` should be removed from `my_dict`.

 

# dict1 = dict(key1='This is not that hard', key2='Python is still cool')

# dict2 = {'key1': 123, 'special_key': 'secret'}

# This is also a away to initialize a dict (list of tuples)

# dict3 = dict([('key2', 456), ('keyX', 'X')])

 

# 'Your impelementation'

# my_dict =


# special_value =
